                I am Praise Victoria Karonji, a passionate and ambitious aspiring software engineer. After recently completing high school, I chose to join Moringa School to stay engaged and nurture my growing interest in software engineering. My journey is driven by a deep curiosity for technology and a desire to create impactful solutions.
                
                I aspire to work at top-tier tech companies such as Google and Pinterest, where I can gain invaluable experience, refine my skills, and contribute to innovative projects. Ultimately, my long-term goal is to branch out and establish my own tech company, where I can lead groundbreaking initiatives and inspire future generations of tech enthusiasts.
